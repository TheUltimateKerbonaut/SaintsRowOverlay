<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheUltimateKerbonaut/SaintsRowOverlay/main/Screenshots/ImGui.png" alt="AND gate screenshot"/>

A DirectX 11 overlay using ImGUI that hooks into Saints Row the Third. With a little tweaking, should work with any game using Direct X 11. Uses:
* ImGui - For debug UI
* Microsoft Detours - For re-routing target functions (trampolining)

## Building
Simply open the solution and build in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.
